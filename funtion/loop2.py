# # types of finite and infinite loop
# basic of infinite loop:
# i=0 
# while i < 20:
    # print(i)
    # i += 1
# name=['charles', 'chris', 'francis', 'job', 'christian', 'victor']
# i=2
# len is used to determine the length of a list
# while i in range (len(name)):
    # print(nmae[i])
    # i += 1

    # # infinite loop
    # they loop until a condition is met
    # score=(input('please enter your score'))
    #  while int (score)  <=20:
    #     print('the score is less than 20')
    #     score = input ('please enter another score:')
    # print('your score is above 20')

    # while int(number) <=10:
    # print('you have won the game')
    # break
    # if int(number) ==8:
# print('number is too low')

# elif int(number) >10:
